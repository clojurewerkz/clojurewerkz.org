## What is ClojureWerkz?

ClojureWerkz is a growing collection of open source Clojure libraries that share a <a href="http://blog.clojurewerkz.org/blog/2013/04/20/how-to-make-your-open-source-project-really-awesome/">common vision</a>:

* [Monger, a Clojure MongoDB driver](http://clojuremongodb.info)
* [Welle, a Clojure client for Riak](http://clojureriak.info)
* [Langohr, a Clojure client for RabbitMQ](https://github.com/michaelklishin/langohr)
* [Neocons, a Clojure client for the Neo4J REST API](http://clojureneo4j.info)
* [Spyglass, a Clojure client for Memcached](http://clojurememcached.info)
* [Quartzite, a powerful scheduling library](https://github.com/michaelklishin/quartzite)
* [Elastisch, a Clojure client for ElasticSearch](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/elastisch)
* [Urly](https://github.com/michaelklishin/urly) unifies java.net.URL, java.net.URI and other URL-like entities
* [Pantomime](https://github.com/michaelklishin/pantomime), a library that deals with Internet media (MIME) types

and several others.


## The vision

ClojureWerkz tries to make a collection of well maintained idiomatic libraries for practical purposes (data store clients,
messaging, data validation, email, etc) that are also well documented, released under the same business-friendly license,
built from the ground up for Clojure 1.4+ and [run continuous integration against multiple Clojure versions](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/languages/clojure/) and JDKs.

We've developed them over the years of using Clojure and we hope it can serve as an example for the rest of the Clojure
community. Or at least they <a href="http://blog.clojurewerkz.org/blog/2013/04/20/how-to-make-your-open-source-project-really-awesome/">don't suck</a>.


## Why?

Clojure is fantastic, small, very productive and powerful language built on industrial
strength runtimes (JVM, JavaScript VMs, .NET/CLR). Thanks to access to existing Java, C# and JavaScript libraries,
it is typically not an issue to find a library that does what you need. Finding a good library that is also feature complete
and well documented, however, is more challenging.

ClojureWerkz tries to challenge this and make the Clojure community a better place.



## Who is responsible for it?
